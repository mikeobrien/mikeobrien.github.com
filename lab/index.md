### Introduction

Building scientific apparatus can be challenging when you are first starting out. The purpose of this site to act as a living lab book to help experimenters get up to speed on a few lab technologies and techniques. 

**DISCLAIMER**: I am not a professional physicist or electrical engineer. Although I do my best to present the material as accurately as possible I cannot make any guarantees. Also some experiments involve very high voltages (> 100kV) which can seriously injure or kill. YOU are responsible for educating yourself and for your own safety.

### <a id="learning-resources"></a> Learning Resources

The following resources have been very helpful to me in general. I will note resources that cover specific topics in their respective sections on the site.

- [Exploring Quantum Physics through Hands-on Projects](http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Quantum-Physics-through-Projects/dp/1118140664) by David and Shanni Prutchi. Most of the content on this site is inspired by this book so I would highly recommend picking up a copy as I will be referencing it often. Also take a look at [their website](http://www.diyphysics.com/) as it contains quite a bit of supplementary information.

- [Building Scientific Apparatus](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Scientific-Apparatus-John-Moore/dp/0521878586). This is the experimenters bible; fabricating, vacuum, electronics, optics and more. If you are doing any serious experimentation, this book is a must have.

- [Introduction to Solid State Chemistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI7D2lkcF8E&list=PL36EC6A6180271B0F) - [Donald Sadoway, MIT Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering](http://donaldsadoway.com/). Don't let the course title fool you, this isn't your father's first year chemistry course. Sadoway is an amazing lecturer who really makes the material come alive. Lectures 1-14 cover quantum theory and condensed matter physics. The lectures on organic and biochemestry are also fantastic.

- [Modern Physics: From The Atom to Big Science](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/history-181b-spring-2008-modern/id461116019) - [Cathryn Carson Berkley Dept. of History](http://history.berkeley.edu/people/cathryn-carson). This is a truly unique course that digs into the history of physics starting with Newton and on into the 21st century. She does a masterful job of explaining the relevant physics as well as the social and political context. I've listened to these over and over and glean something new each time. The discussion of radiation and quantum physics in lectures 12-15 and 20-26 is highly relevant to the content on this site.

- [Theoretical Concepts in Physics](http://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Concepts-Physics-Alternative-Reasoning/dp/052152878X) - [Malcolm Longair](http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/people/longairm.php). This fantastic text takes you through the history of physics, closely examining a number pivotal theories and their development. Chapters 11-15 on quantum theory are highly relevant to the content on this site.

### <a id="supplies"></a> Supplies

Finding and purchasing supplies can be challenging at first. The most cost effective approach, of course, is to buy surplus and [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/) has been the best place I've found for surplus. The following are a few tips on shopping for surplus on eBay:

- Always checkout the sellers negative and neutral reviews no matter what their feedback score is. The feedback score is a pretty poor indicator IMO. I've gotten burned a few times and if I would have looked at the negative reviews I would have saved myself a lot of trouble. You want to see how they handle customer service when something goes wrong and thats where you will see it. Two sellers in particular I would avoid are [supertechshop](http://www.ebay.com/usr/supertechshop) and [svcstore](http://www.ebay.com/usr/svcstore), both eBay stores for Silicon Valley Compucycle. Read [supertechshop](http://www.ebay.com/usr/supertechshop)'s negative reviews and you'll understand why.

- Use the eBay RSS feeds keep on top of new listings. Do a search on eBay and then tack on `&_rss=1` to the url and it will return RSS for that search. You can then use a feed reader or other method to monitor new listings. I personally use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) to post the results to a private twitter feed.

- See how much the item has sold for in the past so you can get a good idea how much is a reasonable amount to pay. Under advanced search you will see an option for sold listings.

- When listings have a Make Offer option don't be afraid to make a really low offer, even up to 80%. Some sellers are just trying to move surplus and are not necessarily sure how much its worth. Not every seller will go low but its always worth a try. Also as you get a feel for how much things cost you'll develop a sense for what a good offer would be.
