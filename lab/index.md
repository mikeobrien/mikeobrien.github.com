### Introduction

Building scientific apparatus can be challenging when you are first starting out. The purpose of this site to act as a living lab book to help experimenters get up to speed on a few lab technologies and techniques. 

**DISCLAIMER**: I am not a professional physicist or electrical engineer. Although I do my best to present the material as accurately as possible I cannot make any guarantees. Also some experiments involve very high voltages (> 100kV) which can seriously injure or kill. YOU are responsible for educating yourself and for your own safety.

### <a id="learning-resources"></a> Learning Resources

The following resources have been very helpful to me in general. I will note resources that cover specific topics in their respective sections on the site.

- [Exploring Quantum Physics through Hands-on Projects](http://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Quantum-Physics-through-Projects/dp/1118140664) by David and Shanni Prutchi. Most of the content on this site is inspired by this book so I would highly recommend picking up a copy as I will be referencing it often. Also take a look at [their website](http://www.diyphysics.com/) as it contains quite a bit of supplementary information.

- [Building Scientific Apparatus](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Scientific-Apparatus-John-Moore/dp/0521878586). This is the experimenters bible; fabricating, vacuum, electronics, optics and more. If you are doing any serious experimentation this book is a must have.

- [Introduction to Solid State Chemistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI7D2lkcF8E&list=PL36EC6A6180271B0F) - [Donald Sadoway, MIT Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering](http://donaldsadoway.com/). Don't let the course title fool you, this isn't your father's first year chemistry course. Sadoway is an amazing lecturer who really makes the material come alive. Lectures 1-14 cover quantum theory and condensed matter physics. The lectures on organic and biochemestry are also fantastic.

- [Modern Physics: From The Atom to Big Science](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/history-181b-spring-2008-modern/id461116019) - [Cathryn Carson Berkley Dept. of History](http://history.berkeley.edu/people/cathryn-carson). This is a truly unique course that digs into the history of physics starting with Newton and into the 21st century. She does a masterful job of explaining the relevant physics as well as the social and political context. I've listened to these over and over and glean something new each time. The discussion of radiation and quantum physics in lectures 12-15 and 20-26 is highly relevant to the content on this site.

- [Theoretical Concepts in Physics](http://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Concepts-Physics-Alternative-Reasoning/dp/052152878X) - [Malcolm Longair](http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/people/longairm.php). This fantastic text takes you through the history of physics, closely examining a number pivotal theories and their development. Chapters 11-15 on quantum theory are highly relevant to the content on this site.
