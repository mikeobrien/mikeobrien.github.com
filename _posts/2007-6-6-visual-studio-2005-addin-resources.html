<P>Having just built a couple of VS2005 addins I wanted to share a couple of resources that really helped me:</P>
<P><A href="http://west-wind.com/weblog/posts/3862.aspx">Creating Menu Bitmaps and AboutIcons for Add-ins in Visual Studio .NET 2005</A><BR><A href="http://west-wind.com/weblog/posts/746.aspx">Creating a CommandBar and adding Commands to it in a VS.NET Add-in</A><BR><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=79C7E038-8768-4E1E-87AE-5BBBE3886DE8&displaylang=en">Visual Studio 2005 Automation Samples</A></P>
<P>Hopefully when I get more time I can post a walk through. Many thanks to <A href="http://west-wind.com/weblog/">Rick Strahl</A> who seems to always have&#160;good info on how to do advanced development in .NET!&#160;9 times out of 10 I'll find something on his blog/site, great resource!</P>
