<P>The library found <A href="http://labs.mikeobrien.net/view.aspx?projectid=zip2coords">here</A> allows you to obtain the physical coordinates of a zip code. This can be useful when dealing with weather or map related services that require a latitude and longitude as input but where the user would be providing a zip code. This small library (With a footprint of about 650k) contains the zip code to coordinate mapping as a binary resource embedded in the DLL, so no additional files or interaction with a web service is required. The data contained in the library was obtained through the US Census Bureau and is current as of the year 2000. If a zip code is not contained in the data the nearest match is returned.</P>
