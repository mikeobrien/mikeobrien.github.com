title: WiX Latest Build
tags: [WiX, Visual Studio 2008]

<p>I mistakenly grabbed the latest WiX installer from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=105970&package_id=168888">here</a> but the latest builds for version 3 are <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases/">here</a> under the weekly releases. There was an issue with the 3.0.2925 release with referencing the NETFRAMEWORK35 property in the WixNetFxExtension. This is fixed in later releases.</p>  <p>BTW, WiX rocks! Visual Studio 2008 integration is very nice. If you are looking for an alternative to the stock VS setup project and need more control over the MSI, I'd <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/">check it out</a>.</p>
