<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Tahoma color=#000000>Apparently you cannot set the IDENTITY flag for a column by simply using an ALTER TABLE/ALTER COLUMN in SQL Server 2000 (Not sure about 2005). I spent some time roaming around BOL and couldn't seem to figure out how to do it. From what I have been reading Enterprise Manager has to jump through some hoops to accomplish this when you set the flag though the GUI.</FONT></P>
