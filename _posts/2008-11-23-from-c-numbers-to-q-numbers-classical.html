<P>I was reading a paper by <A href="http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Carson/">Cathryn Carson</A> (Who teaches a <A href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978529">phenomenal course on the history of physics</A>), "The Origins of the Quantum Theory", and noticed an interesting book in the box "Suggestions for Further Reading" called "From c-Numbers to q-Numbers: The Classical Analogy in the History of Quantum Theory". Unfortunately this publication is out of print but it is <A href="http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft4t1nb2gv">available on the eScholarship website</A>. I also took the liberty of converting it to a PDF to make it easier to print out.</P>
