<P>This should actually be "System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IndexerName" from what I can tell. It appears that there is a typo in the <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2549tw02.aspx">MSDN docs</A> (And <A href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CSharp">elsewhere on the web</A>)&#160;unless I'm just totally missing something here... Supposedly its in the mscorlib.dll but I couldnt seem to find a "CSharp" class anywhere under System.Runtime.CompilerServices either in v1.1 or v2.0. And other CSharp classes elsewhere did not contain the "IndexerName" attribute. Weird. <A href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/TruthIsOutThere.gif">The truth is out there</A>...</P>
