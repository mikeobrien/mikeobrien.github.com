title: Setting up nginx, Mono and ASP.NET on the RaspberryPi
tags: [RaspberryPi, Mono, ASP.NET]

**UPDATE: Much of this post is no longer valid with the [new Raspbian image](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads). For example the steps in the Initial Setup section are now automated in the initial setup screen. Also wheezy ships with a newer version of mono, so depending on your needs, there may no longer be a need to download and compile the latest source.**

Thanks to the all the sources on the interwebs for help compiling these steps. These instructions assume you're running Debian image on your pi. If you havent set that up see [here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) for further instructions.
