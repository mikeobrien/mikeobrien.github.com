<p>I found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730294.aspx">this</a> page helpful as it describes the protocols/versions supported by the different WCF bindings. I also found <a href="http://webservices20.blogspot.com">this blog</a> about WCF and interoperability very helpful as well.</p>
