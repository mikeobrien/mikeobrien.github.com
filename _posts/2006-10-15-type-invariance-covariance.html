<P>In OOP, type variance refers to the difference between a class and its descendant or ascendant. For example lets say we have three classes; Vehicle, Spacecraft and Shuttle. Shuttle inherits from Spacecraft which inherits from Vehicle. They all vary by type. Vehicle is the contravariant of Spacecraft since Vehicle is Spacecraftâ€™s ancestor whereas Shuttle is the covariant of Spacecraft since Shuttle is a descendant of Spacecraft. Invariance simply refers to a lack of variance. For example a parameter or return type that must be invariant cannot respectively accept or return an ancestor or descendant of the type specified, they can only accept or return the specified type.</P>
