<p>I came a cross an excellent course on the <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu">Berkeley webcast site</a> on the history of physics. I really like the coverage of the development of classical physics starting with Newton. Cathryn really does a good job of getting you thinking in the context of the time period, avoiding contemporary terms and thought and helping you to look at things from the perspective of these scientists. She also does a great job of tying in the religious, political, economical and philosophical influences of the time and how they affected the thinking of these individuals.</p>  <p>   <table><tbody>       <tr>         <td><img src="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles/issue14/universitypix/university_01_tn.jpg" /></td>          <td valign="top"><a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978529"><font size="3"><strong>History 181B Modern Physics: From The Atom to Big Science</strong></font></a>             <br />Cathryn Carson             <br />            <br />"Establishment of the ideas and institutions of modern physics.
