<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature">Nomenclature</a> is contrasted with the tale of Romeo and Juliet:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Romeo</strong>: Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this? <br><strong>Sadoway</strong>: Fellas, when this opportunity comes up don't say a word... Don't interrupt! Romeo wisely takes that path... </p> <p>...</p></blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>Juliet</strong>: <em><strong>What's in a name?</strong></em> That which we call a rose by any other word, would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title. Romeo, doth thy name! And for that name, which is no part of thee, take all myself.<br><strong>Sadoway</strong>: That's an offer... </p></blockquote> <p>In Chemistry, names are important. They must be agreed upon by consensus so that we know what each other is talking about. Sadoway also contrasts a lack of agreement to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> where the characters give words the meaning they intend. </p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry_%28etymology%29#Egyptian_origin">Chemistry possibly had roots in ancient Egypt</a> with embalming of the dead. These <em>chemical processes</em> were referred to in hieroglyphics as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry_(etymology)">khemeia</a> (Key may uh ?). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife#ca_1500_BC:_Egyptian">The Egyptians where very keen on preserving the dead for their afterlife journey</a> so those who knew how to employ these chemical processes of embalming were greatly valued. This later expanded to dying of cloth, making of colored glass and metals extraction.</p> <p>400 BCE, Chemistry begins to move from "craft to science" with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus">Democritus</a>, a Greek Philosopher. At that time only about 9 discreet elements (found in nature) were known (Fe, Cu, Ag, Au, Hg, C, Sn, Pb, S). (Interesting side point; where do we find pure elemental iron in nature {Not Hematite, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>}? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_meteorite">Meteorites</a>...) So with only this information Democritus stated that the physical world is made up of VOID + BEING. He also stated that being is made up of an infinity of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">atoms</a>" (From the Greek word atomos which means 'indivisible', a {not} + tomo {divisible}) which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chemistry#The_discovery_of_fire_and_atomism">small particles that are indivisible</a>. His description of void is strikingly similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum">vacuum</a> as we know it today. Sadoway says "That takes us right up to E=mc<sup>2</sup>!"</p> <p>Unfortunately, this fairly accurate description of the physical world by Democritus is supplanted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s view of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element">4 essences (Or elements)</a>; Fire, Earth, Water & Air. </p> <p align="center"><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/3.091Lecture1Taxonomyofchemicalspecies_137D0/image.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="180" alt="image" src="/content/af07cd8b17fe484c9ee5e97d684e857a.png" width="240" border="0"></a> </p> <p>Combinations of these can produce compounds such as "dry", a combination of "fire" & "earth". Sadoway says "This is nuts!! This is nuts!! This is so stupid it defies description!". The fifth essence, that which comprises the heavenly bodies, can be obtained by distilling any of the 4 essences. This was the "scientific" view up through the middle ages. </p> <p>As time went on however more elements were discovered. And they were <em><strong>characterized by their properties</strong></em>. Now we are getting back to science.</p> <p>1776: H, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Pt, Au, Hg, C, N, O, P, S, As, Sn, Sb, Pb, Bi</p> <p>The first characterization of the elements came from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton">John Dalton</a> who created a listing of the elements in 1803 where he assigned symbols and sorted the elements by atomic mass. </p> <p align="center"><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/3.091Lecture1Taxonomyofchemicalspecies_137D0/image_4.png" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="417" alt="image" src="/content/fccb44d1bfc5443dbe150d69c33e9f5d.png" width="297" border="0"></a></p>
