<P>There is a <A href="http://labs.mikeobrien.net/view.aspx?projectid=hidlibrary">new version of the Hid Library</A> in the <A href="http://labs.mikeobrien.net">labs</A>. It has been converted to .NET 2.0 and includes a bug fix. This bug fix involved how the vendor and product id were cast in the structure consumed by the Hid API. So some devices like Logitec's gamepads would not be recognized by their product and vendor id's. Now that issue is resolved. N-joy!</P>
