<P>Have you ever wanted to embed an HTTP server into your application? For example let’s say you have a Windows service that you want to administer or monitor (Google desktop is a good example of this). Or let’s say you have an application that requires an alternate interface such a kiosk application. Wouldn’t it be great to have an embedded HTTP server that would allow you to provide a web interface for your application without requiring IIS and without requiring you to write a web server? If so then Lomez is your friend!</P>
<P>Lomez is an in-process HTTP server that allows you to create virtual directories, serve static content from a file or embedded resource and expose any object by implementing the HTTPHandler interface. It loosely resembles ASP.NET to allow you to use it with ease. </P>
<P>Ok, enough of the spiel… Basically I have a number of applications I work with that I would love to have HTTP access to, especially Windows services. I have looked high and low but have not found a library to allow me to do this. So at that point I figured I would have to develop something myself and Lomez was born. I have successfully used this library in a production kiosk framework (At 2 tradeshows so far) and it has worked like a champ. The current version of the library can be found <A href="http://labs.mikeobrien.net/view.aspx?projectid=lomez">here</A>. I would love to hear any feedback you might have on it. </P>
<P>I consider the current version more of a proof of concept and would really like to rewrite it from the ground up. So hopefully I can begin doing that soon. I would really like to include basic authentication, challenge/response and SSL in the next version. I would also like to optimize the HTTP pipeline so it is lean -n- mean. It’s definitely not right now.</P>
<P>Anyways, if you end up on this page because you are looking for an in-process HTTP server for .NET please let me know your thoughts. And if you decide to use the library, let me know what you think of it.</P>
<P>Thanks!</P>
