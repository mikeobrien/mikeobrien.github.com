This seems like a very innovative approach as a team scattered around the world could shoot and post process video in a collaborative way. I just recently watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476240/">La gran final</a> (Great movie BTW) and I bet Novacut would have been perfect for a project like that. The project primarily aims to facilitate indy film and TV production which lately, IMO, outshines the big production houses. Anyways, check it out <a href="http://novacut.com/">here</a> and back it financially <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/novacut/novacut-entertainments-next-step">here</a>.</p>
