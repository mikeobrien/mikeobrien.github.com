<p>Just a note; to get the sound working on a VirtualBox guest OS of the flavor WinSvr2008R2 you will need to download and update the "Multimedia Audio Controller" device driver with the "AC'97 Audio Codecs" driver found <a href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/">here</a>. More info about it <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/2785">here</a>.</p>
