<P>Zipped source files are getting really lame! I found a hosted Subversion solution (<A href="http://www.wush.net/subversion.php">wush.net</A>)&#160;for about 7 bucks a month and am hosting all the source code for the <A href="http://labs.mikeobrien.net">Labs</A>&#160;there. The setup was very simple and I was up and running in about&#160;15 minutes. The starter package gives you 1 repository and 100mb of space, plenty for personal use. You can browse the repository <A href="https://wush.net/svn/mobrien/">here</A> with a web browser, but the best way to access it is using a Subversion client such as <A href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</A>.</P>
