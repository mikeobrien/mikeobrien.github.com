<p>Aside from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roti_canai">roti boom</a> (roti canai with butter and sugar) my favorite treat from Malaysia was the three layer tea (Or Sarawak tea). Its made up of three layers, in the following order from top to bottom: black tea, evaporated milk and gula melaka (Brown coconut sugar in syrup form). Its is served chilled (I mix it up) and not only does it taste awesome its unbelievably refreshing in the stifling Malaysian heat. Most America grocers wont carry brown coconut sugar syrup (Sometimes called palm sugar) so you'll have to shop around at your local Asian grocers. I'd definitely give it a try!</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_GM0kTqLQ9eI/S_plEwEugnI/AAAAAAAAG5I/P8NAstOw7mw/s1600/2010April+3+layer+tea+(2).JPG" width="360" height="480" /></p>
