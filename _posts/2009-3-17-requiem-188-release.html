<p>Requiem 1.8.8 has been released and works like a champ on files downloaded with iTunes 8.1.0.51. I've read in the blog-o-sphere that Apple released another version, 8.1.0.52, that is supposed to break it... again...</p> <p><a href="http://rs370.rapidshare.com/files/210157999/requiem-1.8.8.zip"><font color="#0066cc">http://rs370.rapidshare.com/files/210157999/requiem-1.8.8.zip</font></a></p> <p>Unfortunately while iTunes has dropped DRM on most of its library it still has it applied on all it's audio books (which BTW are ultimately from Audible.com). Bummer, I wish they would drop it from those too. But I guess we're almost there!</p>
