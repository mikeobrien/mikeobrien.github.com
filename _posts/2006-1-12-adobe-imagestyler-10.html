<P>Back in '98 Adobe offered a really cool web graphics product called Image Styler. It wasent the most powerful tool on the market but it had a very streamlined and simple interface and would allow you to create professional web graphics very quickly. I have used it for years now and love it, but unfortunately Adobe mothballed it in 2000 when they released LiveMotion (It's replacement). I never really liked LiveMotion, even though the two products were similar there were some quirky differences. In any event, LiveMotion (A competing product to Macromedia's lineup) was discontinued in '03 and Adobe and Macromedia merged and the rest is history. For those of you who are looking for the full version of ImageStyler you can download it <A href="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0Bynmohn6qHD_ZGNmNDFkMjgtYWQ2MS00MzljLTk1ZmEtNWFmNDFkMTExMmRk">here</A>. It's pretty difficult to find these days which is too bad since IMO it was a great product.</P>
