<p>I've read, listened to and watched a lot of Feynman and if your interested in physics I'd have to say his lectures and books are an <strong>excellent</strong> tool for learning. So I was excited to see that Microsoft Research has posted 7 video lectures Feynman gave at Cornell. There are more in this series so I'm assuming that the other will be put up later. Evidently Bill Gates is a fan of Feynman and <a href="http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/gates-puts-feynman-lectures-online/">purchased them from the BBC to make them available to all</a>. Its called Project Tuva and can be found here:</p>  <p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/index.html">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/index.html</a></p>  <p>Some other great Feynman links:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/aaronsky12?view=videos">Take the world from another point of view interview</a></p>  <p><a href="http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8">The Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.lulu.com/tuvamuch">Audio compiled by Ralph Leighton</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=torrent+%22Feynman+Lectures+on+Physics%22+mp3">The Feynman Lectures on Physics (At Caltech)</a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=ChristopherJSykes&view=videos">Fun to imagine interview</a></p>  <p>Another great lecturer on physics and chemistry is <a href="http://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/faculty/dsadoway/">Donald Sadoway</a> of MIT (Who coincidently <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/business/368079_gatesqa24ww.html">Gates is a fan of as well</a>). His freshman solid state chemistry course is absolutely amazing. The video lectures can be found <a href="http://web.mit.edu/3.091/www/videos.htm">here</a>.</p>
