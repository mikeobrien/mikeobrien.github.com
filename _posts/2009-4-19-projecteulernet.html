<p>I discovered a really cool site called <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> (while reading <a href="http://diditwith.net/CategoryView,category,Project%2BEuler.aspx">Dustin Campbell's blog</a>) that contains about 250 mathematical problems that you can solve in a programing language of your choice. Once registered you can keep track of the problems you have solved. I've been trying to figure out a way to practice F# and this looks like a fantastic way to do it.</p>
