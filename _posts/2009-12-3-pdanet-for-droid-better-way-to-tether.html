<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to plug <a href="http://www.junefabrics.com/android/index.php">PdaNet for Droid</a>. Works like a champeen with the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Droid">Droid</a> and Server 2008 R2. Setup takes just a few minutes and the throughput is great. Definitely worth the one time cost of $30. It also supports BT so you don't have to use the USB cable. Unfortunately since M$ thought that having Aero on a server product was more important than <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=424089">BT support</a> it will take some <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsserver2008r2networking/thread/1ea7b245-684e-4fd0-8784-44fa08ce3ebd">hacks</a> to get that going. </p>  <p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/PdaNetforDroid_D49E/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/blog/images/dd39ac83c69d45029703be5ce358d8a0.png" width="328" height="164" /></a></p>
