<P><A href="http://www.reachmail.net/">Reachmail</A> (the company I work for) is looking for a senior ASP.NET/C# developer. If you are a progressive developer who is a true geek, really understands OO and patterns and is looking for a change, browse to the link below to apply. We are currently located in Naperville but will be moving to downtown Chicago the 1st of July (Within walking distance of Union and Ogilvie). We really need someone who knows their stuff and doesn't require hand holding. Although we need someone who is able to work independently we don't want an independent person (IE "cowboy"); they must be a team player or they wont last long. We have a relaxed environment and a lot of growth.</P>
<P>The software is a <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permission_marketing">permission based</A> email marketing <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service">SAAS</A> written primarily in classic ASP with a SQL Server 2005 back end. Parts of the system are written in VB.NET and C#. One of our goals is to get the application converted over to ASP.NET/C# and rearchitect much of the system. All of our existing .NET code has been upgraded to 3.5 and new development is obviously in 3.5 and C#.</P>
