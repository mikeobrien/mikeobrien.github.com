<p>I was just reading a <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/ian_cooper/archive/2009/09/28/beating-the-duct-programmer-with-generic-domains-subdomains-and-core-domains.aspx">blog post by Ian Cooper</a> about the recent <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html">"duck tape programmer" remarks by Spolsky</a>. Anyways he had a link to a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/design-strategic-eric-evans">DDD presentation by Eric Evans</a>. Great presentation which focused on how to do "strategic design" in legacy systems when adding new functionality. </p>
