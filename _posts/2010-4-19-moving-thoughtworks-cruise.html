<p>Relocating the ThoughtWorks Cruise configuration file is pretty simple. We have our build artifacts located on a separate partition and we wanted the Cruise config file to be located there also. </p><ol><li>Open the server service config file: [Program Files]\Cruise Server\config\wrapper-server.conf </li>
<li>Change the location of the "cruise.config.file" parameter to the new location of the config file.  <br />

</li>
<li>Copy the cruise-config.xml file from the same directory as the server service config file above to the desired location.</li>
<li>Restart the Cruise server service.</li>
