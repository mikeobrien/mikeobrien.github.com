<p>Wow! And I thought MIT had a great lecture selection under <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm" target="_blank">OCW</a>... Berkeley has an archive of lectures on a wide array of subjects in audio and video format. The webcast home page can be found <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
