<p>Thanks to Michael O'Brien of Akron Ohio for letting mikeobrien.net expire! I am now able to drop the stupid hyphen in my domain name. If you are one of the 60 odd people that subscribe to my blog feed (Thanks for subscribing BTW) you should be ok since I use Feed Burner and I'll update the new url there. If you have my old email address it will be exactly the same just without the hyphen. </p>  <p>Life without the hyphen, it's much better than I could have ever imagined.</p>
