<p> A number of years ago I created a .NET library for a project that I was working on that enabled communication with HID devices. I posted the library in <a href="http://labs.mikeobrien.net">the Labs</a> and was surprised at the response I got! Unfortunately it's not the prettiest code as it was written in haste for this project and I really haven't done anything with it since so it's in need of some TLC. I also don't really have time to commit to it now or in the near future. In light of this I've created a CodePlex project for the HID Library, committed the latest source and created a release. I'm hoping to pass this project on to others who have the time and interest to maintain/grow/support it. If you are interested please drop me a line (Click the little envelope in the upper right corner of the page next to "Sign In" or just leave a comment). The new CodePlex url is <a href="http://hidlibrary.codeplex.com/">http://hidlibrary.codeplex.com/</a>.</p><br> <p>"thank you for your support"</p> <p>&#160;</p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/d1d9cefe0f48.NETHidLibrary_9D72/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/blog/images/8286c53d5fea46ac8b3b9f62bff0c6f5.png" width="480" height="359"></a>
