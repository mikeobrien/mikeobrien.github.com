<p>If your developing F# applications and using SVN then you'll be happy to know that the latest version of <a href="http://www.visualsvn.com/visualsvn/">VisualSVN</a> supports F# in VS2010.</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/LatestVersionofVisualSVNSupportsFinVS201_12D29/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/content/0c1b728debe647eaab989330995c14ad.png" width="210" height="267" /></a> </p>  <p>One bummer is that it looks like they aren't considering a Git offering (At least in the "short term" anyways). I inquired about this and here was the answer Olga Dolidze from VisualSVN support gave:</p>  <p><em>"I regret to say but we do not have short-terms plans for developing a     <br />GIT-version of our products..."</em></p>  <p>Although I'm not tied to having VCS functionality in the IDE, it is convenient at times. </p>
