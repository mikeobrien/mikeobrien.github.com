<p>Ahhh! I finally got my <a href="http://web.mit.edu/3.091/www/" target="_blank">3.091 Into to Solid State Chemistry textbook</a>. Its a pretty big book so I'll probably break my back trying to carry it on the train each day. In any event the <a href="http://mit.bkstore.com/" target="_blank">COOP</a> has a few of these left and from what I hear the book will change for next semester. So anyone following the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/3-091Fall-2004/CourseHome/index.htm" target="_blank">OCW</a> might want to order one before they run out. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/3.091/www/course2.htm" target="_blank">These are custom books</a> from <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/" target="_blank">Wiley</a>, specially for 3.091, so you cant get these at Borders or any chain store... I have no idea how different the book will be next semester but it may be different enough were you cant follow the OCW. The COOP is selling used copies for $84.</p>
