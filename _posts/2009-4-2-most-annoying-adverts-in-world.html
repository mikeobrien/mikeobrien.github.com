<p>I have to say the most annoying adverts in the world are these stupid "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-text_advertising">in text advertising</a>" ads and it looks like <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/stay-away-from-in-text-advertising/">I'm not the only one who hates them</a>. For example on the tek-tips.com site:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MostAnnoyingAdvertsintheWorld_E211/image_2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/content/dcef60e05532484bbf39f1378f00f819.png" width="462" height="162"></a> </p> <p>Then when you pass your mouse over (Not even hover!) any double underlined text you get the floating div:</p> <p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/MostAnnoyingAdvertsintheWorld_E211/image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/content/eba56f4735dd4c68a7f49f27bf24fa08.png" width="567" height="304"></a> </p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>I think this type of advertising is extremely invasive since you are probably going to move your mouse pointer across the browser window and inadvertently end up moving over one of these keywords. And they dont have a wait period to see if your really intending to hover over it. As soon as your mouse goes over it, boom! I seem to always trigger these stupid panels (Usually right as I start reading the post), and you either have to wait a few seconds for them to go away or before you can click away (You cant just click away immediately) or you can click the x.</p> <p>So in an effort to disable these I used the old hosts method and redirected the domain where the advert css is loaded. It looks like Vibrant Media is the biggest purveyor of these so I've just redirected their domain. Just open your hosts file, usually <font color="#0000ff" size="2" face="Courier New">C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</font> an add the following:</p> <p><br><font color="#0000ff" size="2" face="Courier New"># Ad blocker<br>127.0.0.1 intellitxt.com<br>127.0.0.1 vibrantmedia.com</font></p> <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2" face="Courier New"></font>&#160;</p> <p>Works like a champeen!</p>
