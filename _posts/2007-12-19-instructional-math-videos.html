<p><a href="http://www.mathtv.com/">MathTV</a> is <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/profile?user=MathTV">posting videos on YouTube</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">(Teasers for their service). There are over 60 so far on a number of different topics. MathTV also has an <a href="http://www.mathtv.com/subscription/index.htm">online subscription</a> for $35 a year which gives you access to hundreds of videos.</span> I like that they are under 10 minutes each and the instructor does a great job of explaining the material.</p>

<span  style="color: red">UPDATE: As Patrick mentions in the comments <a href="http://www.mathtv.com">MathTV is completely free with over 6,000 vids</a>! Thanks Patrick!</span>
