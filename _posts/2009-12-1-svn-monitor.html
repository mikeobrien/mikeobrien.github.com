<p>A <a href="http://blog.grummle.com/">coworker</a> recently told me about <a href="http://www.svnmonitor.com">SVN Monitor</a> an OSS tool that allows you to monitor svn repos and view activity. It's a beautiful app and and it makes it a breeze to keep on top of updates and see what is going on in the codebase. It's sits in the systray so you can easily see when there are updates and you can update right from the systray icon. Check it out!</p>  <p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/SVNMonitor_A3AF/image_5.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/blog/images/33b7d2abf27e4a5383808b47d213767b.png" width="626" height="385" /></a></p>
