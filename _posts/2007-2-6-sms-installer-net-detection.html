<P>For those of you who still use SMS Installer the following&#160;script enables you to detect if a certian version of the .NET Framework is installed on the machine. Just switch over to the "Script Editor", copy the text from the following file and paste it where you want it. Basically it only extracts and runs the redist if the desired version is not installed. This makes the setup run a lot faster for users who will already have a particular version of the framework installed.</P><A href="/blog/downloads/DOTNETSMS.txt">DOTNETSMS.txt (6.23 KB)</A>
