Over the years I and [others](http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_eisenberg/archive/2012/01/04/how-i-lost-regained-and-then-turned-down-an-mvp-award.aspx) [have](http://codebetter.com/karlseguin/2009/02/03/why-aren-t-i-an-mvp/) [observed](http://keyvan.io/on-microsoft-mvp-program) that the current Microsoft MVP program is flawed. What if we had an MVP-esque program that was done right? Paul Betts said he is "[still not convinced the entire concept of the MVP program isn’t flawed](https://twitter.com/xpaulbettsx/status/220643035095105536)". It may in fact be a flawed concept altogether. I'm on the fence about it though because I've never seen it done right. So it's hard to tell if the MVP program is flawed in principle or if it's just Microsoft messing it up. Anyways, here are some thought's on what I think a "good" program would be:

### Core Tenets ### 

A good program would have to be:

* **Community driven**: The community should be the ones deciding who receives these awards. Managers and evangelists have a conflict of interest. Since the awards are about expertise and involvement/contribution to the community, who better to decide than the community. Peer review is necessary here just as it is in the scientific community for example.
* **Transparent**: Everyone would have to know how it works, unlike the mystery that surrounds the Microsoft program. The method for selection should be clearly stated and open for discussion. Even the software that's used for recording and tallying nominations should be open source.
* **Cross-platform**: The award categories should not be limited to a particular set of technologies and should be open for community discussion.

### Benefits ###

I think the benefits could be three fold:

* **Recipients**: Many people work selflessly in communities to help their peers or contribute to open source software. They usually don't receive anything in return. They enjoy what they do and probably don't complain. But I'm sure they wouldn't mind receiving a little recognition for their efforts. And what about some other perks like free software or having their way paid to a conference?
* **Nominators**: I appreciate the work done by a number of people in the communities that I'm apart of. Of course there are a number of ways to express appreciation. I would love to be able to give them props in this way too.
* **Sponsors**: Would be a nice opportunity to give back to the community and from a strictly business perspective, get their brand and software/services out there. JetBrains and GitHub do this and I'm sure it helps their bottom line.

### Execution ###

Some ideas for execution:

* Awarded annually of course.
* Would not be called MVP of course.
* Nominating should be completely community driven. People should be able to upvote their peers in different categories and be able to propose categories.
* Categories could be broad; programming languages, frameworks, software, commercial or open source, but kept reasonably in the sphere of software dev. 
* Any software that is used for the program should be open source.
* Awardees would be automatically chosen at the end of the year, which doesn’t have to be the calendar year, as the top n percent of nominees in the category.
* Primary sponsorship should be provided by a respected and well know organization. I think if it's to be taken seriously it can't be done by an organization that is not liked and respected by devs in general or one that is not widely known. The primary sponsor would coordinate the program and host any software or content required for it. I personally think GitHub would be perfect for this.
* Other sponsors could pledge things for different categories. For example JetBrains could pledge free RubyMine licenses for all ruby awardees. Or CodeStock could offer free tickets to the top 5 awardees in certain categories. 
* Categories shouldn't require sponsorship. So in some cases there would just be recognition, no goodies.

In the end, these types of programs may be flawed and thus only good for self-serving organizations. But it would be interesting to see it done right. It may be that they provide value if executed properly.
