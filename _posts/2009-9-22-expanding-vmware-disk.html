<p>On a number of occasions we’ve had to expand the size of our VMWare disks. This is actually pretty trivial. All you need to do is use the vmware-vdiskmanager utility that ships with VMWare server. For example:</p>  <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Server>vmware-vdiskmanager -x 500GB "D:\Virtual Servers\SomeServer\Data.vmdk"</p>  <p>Also remember the vmdk file you want to choose is the disk descriptor file not the binary file. You can tell the difference by the size and the name suffix: </p>  <p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ExpandingaVMWareDisk_B892/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/content/adaddb4e75424114ad078b320760a927.png" width="425" height="405" /></a> </p>  <p>Once this is done you will need to expand the partition. Server 2008 & 2008 R2 will allow you to do this in the disk manager, even the system partition (I’m assuming that the same would apply to Vista and Windows7 but I have not personally tried it). If your running an earlier OS you can use a partition tool like the <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">GParted Live CD</a>. </p>
