<P><A href="http://cs.hubfs.net/user/Profile.aspx?UserID=2126">Mike Jones</A> has posted an analysis of an adaptation of the Concurrent Life app (That ships with the <A href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</A> distro) <A href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/polyphonic/articles/106.aspx">here</A>. I haven't gotten through the entire article yet but so far it is great. The sample app has a C# interface and consumes an F# library. He suggests that C#'ers not familiar with functional programming use F# imperatively to get comfortable with the language syntax then tackle the functional style.</P>
<P>Also, I came across these articles&#160;by <A href="http://tomasp.net/">Thomas&#160;Petricek</A> that are proving very helpfull:</P>
