<p>Got VS2008 Team System up and running... Only issues I ran into were needing to update the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0c1b0a88-59e2-4eba-a70e-4cd851c5fcc4&displaylang=en" target="_blank">.NET Compact Framework 2.0 to SP1</a> and reinstalling the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=10CC340B-F857-4A14-83F5-25634C3BF043&displaylang=en" target="_blank">.NET Framework 3.0 Redist</a> (I had this installed but something got hosed so I had to reinstall it). I ran the beta versions on a VM so I didn't have to deal with issues resulting from uninstalling betas on my dev box. I'm really liking the VM approach for evaluation!&#160;</p> <p>Rick Strahl has some interesting comments on the VS2008 install <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/192207.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
