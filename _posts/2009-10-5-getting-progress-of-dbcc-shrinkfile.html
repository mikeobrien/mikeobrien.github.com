<p>I'm running a DBCC SHRINKFILE on a HUGE database (315Gb) after a major prune (Around 60%) and it's taking forever. Anyways, found a helpful nugget on the internets for determining it's progress.</p>  <pre class="code"><span style="color: blue">SELECT </span>percent_complete<span style="color: gray">, * </span><span style="color: blue">FROM </span><span style="color: green">sys.dm_exec_requests</span></pre>

<p><a href="http://11011.net/software/vspaste"></a>And you get something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.mikeobrien.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GettingtheProgressofaDBCCSHRINKFILE_A5E8/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/blog/images/2c970025c55f448e9fe167c7c9cf9fd8.png" width="589" height="91" /></a> </p>

<p>I've noticed that even though it says "suspended" it's still progressing. I think it must be that this task is constantly firing off child tasks (Like #194 above) and waiting for them to complete (And thus the status of "suspended" most of the time).</p>
