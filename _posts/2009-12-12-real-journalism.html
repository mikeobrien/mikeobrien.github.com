<p>If your interested in hearing the endless drivel about Tiger Woods recent accident, Sarah Palin, Amanda Knox, Kaylee Anthony, the Salahi's White House party crashing, or Fox "News" partisan fear mongering you know where to go... I think cable news today is a combination of partisan talk radio, The Young and The Restless and Jerry Springer. Pretty sad indeed.</p>  <p>If your interested in *real journalism* covering *real stories* from around the world I'd highly suggest <a href="http://current.com/vanguard-journalism/">Current TV's Vanguard</a>. They do an amazing job of uncovering and reporting on stories that have real substance. They post the latest episodes <a href="http://current.com/vanguard-journalism/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hulu.com/search?query=vanguard&st=0">here</a>.</p>
