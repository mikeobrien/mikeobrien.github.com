<P>Among the many good points Joel makes, one that really struck me was on "illeagal questions" to ask an interviewee. I think some are pretty obvious but I think one really needs to be careful about questions asked in an attempt to take an interest in the person and/or be friendly. For example I love to learn about and understand different cultures, and most people love to talk about their culture and where they are from. So I usually have no qualms about engaging people in this type of conversation. But on an interview this is off limits since it could be taken, not as friendly conversation, but as discriminatory questions regarding race.The following FAQ covers these issues.</SPAN></P>
