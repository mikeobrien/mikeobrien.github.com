<P>Most software, protocols&#160;and&#160;hardware are not compatible with their older versions, not to mention the fact that these versions change frequently. What if you had 50 year old hardware that was compatible with your brand new MacBook Pro? Well on this 50th anniversary of the patent for the original Lego brick we see compatibility at its best; the original Lego brick patented on January 28, 1958 is <A href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/children-build-on-as-lego-turns-50-today/2008/01/27/1201368944863.html">still compatible with bricks purchased today</A>.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, years earlier and only 150 miles away in <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen">Copenhagen</A>, Niels Bohr and his crew formulated many of the principles of Quantum Mechanics. This is appropriate as the connectivity of the Lego brick is in fact quantized...</P>
