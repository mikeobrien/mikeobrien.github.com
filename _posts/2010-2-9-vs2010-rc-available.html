<p>The Visual Studio 2010 RC is available to MSDN subscribers and will be available to the public tomorrow.</p>  <p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/02/08/vs-2010-net-4-release-candidate.aspx"><u><font color="#0066cc">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/02/08/vs-2010-net-4-release-candidate.aspx</font></u></a><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/charlie/archive/2010/02/08/vs-2010-rc-released.aspx"></a></p>  <p><em>UPDATE: I've been playing around with the RC and it seems much faster. Loading/unloading a project and compile times are much better. From what I have seen so far today (With pretty limited use) if feels like its on par with 2008. I guess we'll see more in the days ahead.</em></p>
