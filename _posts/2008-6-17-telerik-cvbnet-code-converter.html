<p>Telerik has a very nice online code converter <a href="http://converter.telerik.com/">here</a>. I've recently been converting VB.NET code to C# and this tool seems to be able to convert code that many of the others out there cannot. The only thing it seems to miss is the parens when converting indexer callers. So it doesn't convert the VB.NET myDataReader("Name") to the C# myDataReader["Name"]. Not a huge deal though.</p>
