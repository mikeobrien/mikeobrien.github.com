<p>As Aaron Stebner <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2009/11/16/9923341.aspx">mentioned</a>, the <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/releases/">latest builds of WiX</a> support VS2010 Beta 2 and automatic project upgrade from VS2008. I had a VS2008 solution that contained a WiX project and the upgrade to VS2010 Beta 2 worked perfectly. Many thanks to the Wix team!</p>
