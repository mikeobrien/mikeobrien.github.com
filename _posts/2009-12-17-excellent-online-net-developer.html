<p>There are a couple of online developer resources that have really stood out. I've benefited from them greatly so I wanted to give them a shout out.</p>  <p>Blogging communities:</p>  <p><a href="http://codebetter.com/">CodeBetter.com</a> &#8211; As an aside <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/matthew.podwysocki/">Matthew Podwysocki</a> blogs here. So if your interested in all sorts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional</a> goodness, this is the place for you.    <br /><a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/">LosTechies.com</a>    <br /><a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/">Devlicio.us</a> </p>  <p>Webcasts:</p>  <p><a href="http://dimecasts.net/">DimeCasts.net</a> &#8211; This site, run by <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/Derik_whittaker/">Derik Whittaker</a> and contributed to by a bunch of really smart people, has a ton of great web casts around ten minutes each (Great for those with ADD) on different topics. Topics include IoC, NHibernate, TDD, CI, SOLID and a bunch of other snazzy acronyms. Lately I've been watching vids on NHibernate and StructureMap and they have been <em><strong>extremely</strong></em> helpful. </p>
