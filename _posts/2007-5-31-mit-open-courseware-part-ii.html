<P>A while ago I posted a link to <A href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">MIT's Open Courseware (OCW) site</A>. Recently I have begun to make use of it and wanted to share some of what I have found. First of all, it rocks! It really is a great resource, especially for those who want to learn about a subject and would like to do self study. I didn't realize this earlier but a number of the courses also publish videos of the lectures. For example <A href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/3-091Fall-2004/CourseHome/index.htm">3.091, "Introduction to Solid State Chemistry"</A> has <A href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/3-091Fall-2004/LectureNotes/index.htm">all 35 lectures posted</A>, thats almost 30 hours of lecture time! These videos (If available) can be found possibly in 3 locations, so keep that in mind. The first is on the <A href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">OCW site</A>. Browse to the course you are interested in, for example <A href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/3-091Fall-2004/CourseHome/index.htm">Introduction to Solid State Chemistry</A>. Under the "<A href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/3-091Fall-2004/LectureNotes/index.htm">Lecture Notes</A>" (This label may be a little different between courses) section you will find the video streams and the lecture notes. The second location is on the <A href="http://web.mit.edu/3.091/www/index.htm">regular class page</A>. 3.091 has a tab called "<A href="http://web.mit.edu/3.091/www/videos.htm">Videos</A>" and another called "<A href="http://web.mit.edu/3.091/www/archives.htm">Archives</A>", both have links to lecture videos and notes. Now the third place you can check, if you want to easily download the videos, is <A href="http://video.google.com">Google Video</A>. Searching for "<A href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=3.091">3.091</A>" brings up all but 2 of the course videos which can be downloaded in in a format that can be played by your video IPod. Actually Google Video has over <A href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=mit+lecture">450 MIT Lectures available for download</A>! There are also nearly <A href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Berkeley+lecture">300 UC Berkeley lectures</A> as well. If you want to download any of the lecture videos (to your hard disk) that are offered as a stream on the MIT website you can use a program like <A href="http://www.flashget.com/en/download.htm">FlashGet</A>&#160;to save the stream as a file and then convert the file to what you want. The MIT site publishes RealVideo streams (That use the RTSP protocol).</P>

<P>You may want to look on the course listing to see if there is a newer version of the course as newer ones are periodically added.</P>
<P>The OCW site also offers the course syllabus, study materials, readings, exams and a number of other resources. They offer the option to download the entire course as a zip file so that you don't have to download the resources individually. </P>
<P>Now a few words about the "<A href="http://web.mit.edu/3.091/www/index.htm">Introduction to Solid State Chemistry</A>" (3.091) course... If you are interested in learning about chemistry I would <STRONG>highly</STRONG> recommend the 3.091 course. <A href="http://web.mit.edu/dsadoway/www/resume.html">Donald Sadoway</A>&#160;is the lecturer for this course and he does an <STRONG>amazing job</STRONG>! You can tell he loves the subject and he knows it very well. He has a great sense of humor and he really makes the material come alive (At least for me anyways). This course lays an excellent foundation for other areas of study.<BR></P>
