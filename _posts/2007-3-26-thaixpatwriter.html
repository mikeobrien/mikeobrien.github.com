<P>I recently reconnected with my yearbook teacher from high school, Jonathon Siminoe, and learned that he is now teaching in Thailand. I highly recommend checking out his <A href="http://www.siminoe.com/">blog</A> and <A href="http://fiction.siminoe.com-a.googlepages.com/home">short stories</A>. He is an <STRONG>excellent</STRONG> writer and I find myself checking his blog every morning, coffee cup in hand, to read about his adventures in this Southeast Asian country. To whet your appetite, may I suggest <A href="http://fiction.siminoe.com-a.googlepages.com/coffeehouserun">Coffee House Run</A> and <A href="http://thaixpatwriter.blogspot.com/2007/03/damn-shiny-car-wash.html">Damn Shiny Car Wash</A>? Great stuff!</P>
