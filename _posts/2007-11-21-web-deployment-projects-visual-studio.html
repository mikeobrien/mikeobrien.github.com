<P>** UPDATE ** A December 2007 CTP is available, more info <A href="http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/2007/12/01/web-deployment-projects-wdp-for-visual-studio-2008-december-2007-ctp-released/">here</A>.</P>
<P>Looks like we will have to wait&#160;a couple of weeks&#160;for WDP support in Visual Studio 2008 as noted by <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-3-5-released.aspx" target=_blank>Scott Guthrie</A>:</P>
<P>"Two popular add-ins to Visual Studio are not yet available to download for the final VS 2008 release.&#160; These are the Silverlight 1.1 Tools Alpha for Visual Studio and the Web Deployment Project add-in for Visual Studio. Our hope is to post updates to both of them to work with the final VS 2008 release in the next two weeks."</P>
