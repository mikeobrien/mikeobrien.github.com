title: Rebinding error in Visual Source Safe
tags: [.NET]
---
<P>I have been running into this problem lately where I try to create a VSS source control binding on a project that already has a binding (Albeit an incorrect one). When I try to bind the project I get this error:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New">"One or more of the project's destination paths are invalid. To open this solution, you must specify valid paths for each project. The error was "The Web at 'http://localhost/yada-yada-yada' already contains a project. You need to choose another location for your Web project.".</FONT></P>
<P>So I have found a solution in a number of blogs/forums that seems to work. Basically you need to remove the source control information for the project in question in the solution file. The lines will look like this:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New">SccProjectUniqueName1 = </FONT><A href="http://localhost/SolutionName/SolutionName.csproj"><FONT face="Courier New">http://localhost/SolutionName/SolutionName.csproj</FONT></A><BR><FONT face="Courier New">SccLocalPath1 = .<BR>CanCheckoutShared = true<BR>SccProjectEnlistmentChoice1 = 2</FONT></P>
<P>Then decrement the SccNumberOfProjects value by 1. Once this has been done, manually reset the binding and your golden!</P>
