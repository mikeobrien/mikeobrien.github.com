<p><a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/WillSmith/archive/2008/02/26/msbuild-server-gotcha.aspx">Will Smith so kindly pointed out</a> that the target file for web application projects is not installed by the .NET 3.5 redist (Along with msbuild). To fix this you can copy over the target file from a machine with VS2008 installed to the same folder on build server. The target file can be found under <ProgramFiles>\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v9.0\WebApplications.</p>
