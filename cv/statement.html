<h4>Statement regarding disclosure of salary history and social media login credentials</h4>

        <p>It’s a challenge for employers to obtain sufficient information about a candidate in order to make a sound hiring decision. I appreciate this fact and am interested in doing all I can to present myself as openly and honestly as I can. There are two area’s however that I feel are not appropriate; salary history and social media credentials.</p>

<h4>Salary History</h4>

<p>Many companies require applicants to disclose salary history. I feel this information is private and is a very poor indicator of a candidates worth and skillset. I have been writing software for over two decades and have seen many people both overpaid and underpaid for their skillset. People lie about salary and work history and most employers do not or cannot verify this information. Also salaries are dependent on the geographical region and experience in particular domains and technologies. Really, the best indicator of a candidates worth to an organization is what they have <i>done</i>, not how much money they have made or claim to make. I provide a number of resources that demonstrate my work and passion for what I do; namely my <a href="http://www.mikeobrien.net/blog/">blog</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/mikeobrien">GitHub profile</a>. Here you can find years of writing about technical topics and open source software I have developed. I feel that my salary should be judged on these merits. That being said, I will not disclose salary history even if it is to my advantage to do so.</p>

<h4>Social Media Login Credentials</h4>

<p>There has been a trend of <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/employer-access-to-social-media-passwords-2013.aspx">companies requiring applicants to provide login credentials for social media sites such as Facebook</a>. I feel this is an egregious violation of privacy and will not engage with any company that asks for this information, even if I am not required to provide it.</p>
